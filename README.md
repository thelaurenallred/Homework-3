# Homework-3

  When designing my test data, the easiest part was writing the generatedata.py file. It was straightforward; create a random string of dna with for loops and the random.randint function. The most difficult part was writing the processdata.py file. It was a difficult to get the counters set up right so that it would be able to calculate the percentage of how many reads align once, twice, or never. 
  When doing this homework assignment I was able to get good practice between the difference of strings and lists. It also helped me to improve my conciseness of loop and if statements. I enjoyed doing the code because it was a real world situation that could be used in the industry.
  My code works for my test data, so it in theory should work for any data set. The process for analyzing the data will be the same regardless of the reads and reference files. My code handled 100,000 reads so it would be able to handle large data sets.
